# list-of-users
This is a full stack web application of a list where you can add, remove or modify users. The list is connected to a MySQL database with PHP, Javascript and AJAX.
To use the application you have to connect it to a databse named 'list' with a table named 'users' with columns 'name', 'last name', 'addres', 'phone'. Or you can use your own database, but you have to change the PHP and Javascript code.
